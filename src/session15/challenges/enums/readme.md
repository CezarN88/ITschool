1. Create an enum called LightColor that represents the three colors of a traffic light: red, yellow, and green. Each color should have a string representation and a duration (in seconds) associated with it (e.g., red = "Stop", 30 seconds; yellow = "Caution", 5 seconds; green = "Go", 45 seconds).

2. Create a day scheduler application that uses an enum to represent the days of the week. The application should be able to assign and retrieve activities for each day

3. Extend an enum representing car types to include properties such as average price and manufacturer. Override the toString method to provide a descriptive string representing each enum constant.
